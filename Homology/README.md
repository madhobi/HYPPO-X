Persistent homology
====================
The topological object generated from our `C++` has a overlapping parameter and the shape of a topological object depends on this overlapping value. In order to avoid this parametric value by making it constant, we used persistent homology technique. We implemented the code in `Java` using an opensource library [javaplex-4.3.0.jar](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/releases/tag/4.3.0).

### Input
We generated the input from our `C++` code. In the `config.h` file there has a constant named `PRINT_BARCODE` which is by default `false`. By making it `true`, we can generate the codes used for persistent homology. The code is responsible for creating barcode. Copy these code block and paste at the following part of the `java` file to generate the barcode:
```Java
public void GetStreamForData(ExplicitSimplexStream stream) {
	// Place the barcode simplex timeline code generated by the C++ code
}
```

#### One can change the barcode file name and maximum range of timeline of a simplex using fillowing code snap in the `main` method of the `Barcode.java` file. For our dataset, the maximum timeline value is `50`.
```Java
edu.stanford.math.plex4.api.Plex4.createBarcodePlot(intervals_index, "[FILE Name PREFIX]", [MAX TIMELINE]);
```

### Output
The output is a barcode image. The file name with suffix `X` means the barcode image generated for dimension `X`, where `X` could be any integer value starting from `0`.
