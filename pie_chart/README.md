Canvas
======
The `HTML 5` object named `canvas` is used here to represent graph more meaningfully using `pie chart` and color. 

### Input
The output of our graph plotting project using `R` is saved in an `eps` formatted image file. Later, we converted this image file from `eps` to `png`, which is used as a background image of this project. We plotted pie chart on the node position of the background image. The `JSON` data to generate `pie chart` was generated from our main `C++` project, where the constant in the configuration file named `PIE_CHART_CODE` controlls whether the code will generate `JSON` data or not.

### Output
Run the `HTML` file in any `HTML 5` supported browser. One can save the image in a `png` formatted file.
