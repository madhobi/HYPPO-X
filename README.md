GxE-TDA
=======

This is a high dimensional data visualization tool. This tool is mainly built in `c++`. The object that we generated from our method is a graph and we used `iGraph package of R` to visually represent the graph. We also use `HTML canvas` to represent the graph more meaningfully using pie chart and colors.
