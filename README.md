GxE-TDA
=======

This is a high dimensional data visualization tool. This tool is mainly built in `c++`. The object that we generated from our method is a graph and we used `iGraph package of R` to visually represent the graph. We also use `HTML canvas` to represent the graph more meaningfully using pie chart and colors.

## TDA
Topological data ananlysis (TDA) uses [![algebraic topology](algebraic topology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology) (a branch of mathematics) which deals with point clouds and generate the shape of point cloud data in a coordinateless fashion. There has three steps through which TDA generates the shape of a dataset and these are:

- [Filtering](#filtering)
- [Partial clustering](#partial_clustering)
- [Topological object construction](#topological_object_construction)
