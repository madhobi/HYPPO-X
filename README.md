This is a hypothesis extraction tool from high dimensional phenomix dataset. This tool is mainly built in `C++`. The object that we generate from our method is a graph and we use [D3](https://d3js.org/) to visualize our object.

## Library
The library uses c++14 and requires [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) with version 1.48.0 or more recent. It is a multi-platform library and compiles on Linux, Mac OSX and Visual Studio 2015.

## Website
```R
The interactive php based website uses the output generated by the library. Library generates graph in JSON format and the website reads this JSON file to visually represent the object. Use any php server (Apache) to host the website. 
```

## Library + Website
Follow the steps to interface Library with the website:
```R
1. Put the csv data file to `Website/dev/Data/csv` folder.
2. Create a folder in `Website/dev/Data/json` with same name as the name of the csv data file.
3. Assign write permission to the new created folder.
4. During running the library, set `-RD` param to `Website/dev/Data/json` and set `-WD` param to `Website/dev/Data/json`
5. The library will read the csv file from `-RD` location and write the json file to `-WD` location.
6. Refresh the website to observe the topological object.
